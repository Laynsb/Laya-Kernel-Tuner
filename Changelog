~ V2.0-stable
• Massive compatibility update and added bunch of kernel support from 4.14-6.12 (AOSP Optimized Value)
• [MLPO] Added Machine learning Profile optimization to intelligently learn user patterns and adjust kernel tweaks
• [BCL] Added Battery Curve Learning Monitor to learn battery pattern, health, usage, activity to improve decision making for better battery preservation and performance
• Optimize Profile selection logic to choose the best profile for current user activity
• Memory pressure detection: Now single-pass through meminfo (vs dual-pass fallback)
• I/O activity monitoring: ~10x faster on systems with 100+ block devices (common on some configurations)
• Dropped unused variable & import
• Multiple optimization on kernel values

~ V1.0-stable
• Initial stable release build written on rust (Not much feature was added but will enhance in the future)
• Trigger tweaks every 5s on screen on, every 15s on screen off for more responsive experience
• Optimizes vm.*, net.*, kernel.*, and fs.* parameters
• Set kernel tweaks (Powersave, Balanced, Performance) with Adaptive Strategies based on user activity
