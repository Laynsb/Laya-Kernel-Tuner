----- V5.1.1-stable -----
• Fix Minor performance overhead
• Solved Multiple code warnings
• Remove kmsg write
• Remove unnecessary string allocations in hysteresis
• Code optimization

----- V5.0-stable -----
• Fix and patch bunch of things
• Refinement was made towards Machine Learning code
• Improved Battery awareness
• Fix up! Battery sampling monitor logic
• Fix up! profile selection for idle mode
• Fix up! battery charging detection minor issue
• Improved hystresis history tracking
• Etc, lazy to make changelog lmao

----- V4.0-stable -----
Added:
(1) Periodic status logging every ~60 seconds
(2) 30-second startup grace period to prevent stutter right after boot
(3) Fallback logging to /dev/kmsg in addition to logcat

Changed:
(1) Rewrote entire profile selection with intelligent multi-factor scoring

Fixed:
(1) Minor issue on logging

Improved:
Detection functions:
(1) Charging now checks battery status first (Charging/Discharging/Full) before USB/AC online, 
(2) Thermal scans all 16 thermal zones and handles both millidegrees and degrees, 
(3) Memory uses MemAvailable with fallback to Free+Buffers+Cached calculation.
Profile Selection logic:
(1) Decison making on every possible user behavior


----- V3.0-stable -----
Added:
• CPU frequency usage detection
• Thermal state monitoring (0-100% scale)
• Charging state detection
• Network activity tracking
• Hysteresis system (3-cycle consensus before profile switching)
• 15 new kernel parameters to enhance experience

Changed:
• Profile selection: Binary thresholds & Weighted scoring system
• Much more (i forgot)

Removed:
• Old threshold constants (replaced by weighted scoring)

Improved:
• Integer overflow protection (saturating arithmetic everywhere)
• Division-by-zero guards (all 18 divisions protected)
• Bounds validation (battery, RAM, thermal all clamped)
• Profile stability (no more thrashing with hysteresis)
• Thermal safety (emergency override at >75°C)
• Memory protection (min_free_kbytes prevents deadlocks)
• Gaming performance (512K memory maps, ultra-low latency)
• Network performance (TCP Fast Open, 16MB buffers)
• Error handling (all file ops safe, graceful fallbac
ks)

----- V2.0-stable -----
• Massive compatibility update and added bunch of kernel support from 4.14-6.12 (AOSP Optimized Value)
• [MLPO] Added Machine learning Profile optimization to intelligently learn user patterns and adjust kernel tweaks
• [BCL] Added Battery Curve Learning Monitor to learn battery pattern, health, usage, activity to improve decision making for better battery preservation and performance
• Optimize Profile selection logic to choose the best profile for current user activity
• Memory pressure detection: Now single-pass through meminfo (vs dual-pass fallback)
• I/O activity monitoring: ~10x faster on systems with 100+ block devices (common on some configurations)
• Dropped unused variable & import
• Multiple optimization on kernel values

~ V1.0-stable
• Initial stable release build written on rust (Not much feature was added but will enhance in the future)
• Trigger tweaks every 5s on screen on, every 15s on screen off for more responsive experience
• Optimizes vm.*, net.*, kernel.*, and fs.* parameters
• Set kernel tweaks (Powersave, Balanced, Performance) with Adaptive Strategies based on user activity
• For detailed information check readme on github
